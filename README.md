A (very) simple starting point to use ES6 & beyond features in the browser today with Webpack and Babel.

Out of the box includes features up to stage 0, tweak to your needs.

If you don't have webpack installed globally do so by running `npm install webpack -g`.

- `npm install` and `npm start` to start the live-reload dev server.
- `npm run build` will build the site for development use, or `npm run production` to build the minified production version. The site will be output into the `/dist` folder.
- for conveniece `npm run clean` will remove the `/dist` folder.
