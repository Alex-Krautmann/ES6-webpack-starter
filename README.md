A (very) simple starting point to use ES6 & beyond features in the browser today with Webpack and Babel.

Out of the box includes features up to stage 0, tweak to your needs.

Also supports SASS, just create your `*.scss` file in `/app` and require it, or simply change the sample file provided.

## Usage

If you don't have webpack installed globally do so by running `npm install webpack -g`.

- `npm install`
- `npm start` to start the live-reload dev server.
- `npm run build` will build the site for development use, or `npm run production` to build the minified production version. The site will be output into the `/dist` folder.
- `npm run clean` will remove the `/dist` folder.
